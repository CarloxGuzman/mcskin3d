- Fixed undo/redo getting lost on player switch (originally was intended, removed now and switching works fine without committing)

- Changed the visuals of the toolbar and menu strips
- Fixed commit not re-enabling under certain circumstances
- Removed some extraneous events

- Decided, at release time, to start writing down things I change as I do them so I don't forget
- Now including the Program Debug Database (pdb) file, so that crashes give me more important information

- Only draws grass on top face now, won't get in the way if you try to paint the feet
