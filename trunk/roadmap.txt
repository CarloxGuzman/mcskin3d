1.4:
*- Better versioning system (minor/build as well)
?-- Update program
*- Custom model support
?-- All models supported by 1.0 included
*- Custom brushes
*- Deleting all skins (folders, etC) causes errors.
*- Drag-drop from program to folder
*- Pick up on external file changes (this might be really tough to do in a non-Windows environment)
   -- NOTE: STILL NOT PERFECT
*- Depth-sort alpha
   -- NOTE: per face? D:
*- Make 1x1 the default brush
*- Check upload size (apparently is broken)
*- Hex issues (more than 10 symbols = crash)

1.3:
?- Hopefully, get an optimized color class (not super-high priority)
*- Verify all undo buffers
*- Secondary color
*- Merge Dodge and Burn into one tool
*- Darken/Lighten tool
*- Tool options (perhaps expandable panel below the toolbar?)
*- Finish the treeview
*- Add "Overlays" folder, customizable background image
*- Hidden part "ghosting"
*- Modifyable Brush Size for pencil/eraser/dodge/burn/darken/lighten, exposure for Dodge/Burn/Darken/Lighten, "feather" for pencil/eraser/dodge/burn/darken/lighten.
*- Noise tool
*- Circle brushes
*- Part lock for fill bucket/noise tool
\- Feathering on brushes
\- Grid for 2d view?
\- Find a better way to do the tool options
