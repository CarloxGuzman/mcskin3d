1.4:
*- Better versioning system (minor/build as well)
?-- Update program
*- Custom model support
*- Custom brushes
*- Deleting all skins (folders, etC) causes errors.
*- Drag-drop from program to folder

?- Clear skin option
?- Handle more upload errors
?- Selection tool, copy/paste
?- Allow "old-style" drag/drop in case the COM entry for drag/drop is missing.
?- Allow change to main skin directory (hold multiple directories as well?)
?- Check upload size (apparently is broken)
?- Tutorial system
?- Hex issues (more than 10 symbols = crash)
?-- All blocks and mobs supported by 1.0 included
?- Don't rely on OpenGL to store finalized image
?- Swatch editor
?- Cleanup moar
?- Optimized color class
?- Add other "common" color formats (CMYK, etc)
?- Consider interface changes
?- Fix smooth brushes
?- Mouse shortcuts / "multitool"
?- Posing
?- Pick up on external file changes (this might be really tough to do in a non-Windows environment)
?- Mineshafter support
?- Fit keyboard shortcuts into tooltips
?- Automatically hide/show helmet based on transparency contained in helmet
?- Smudge tool
?- Double-check language strings, ensure all English strings in source are language-ized

?- Automated saving.
?- Make sure people are aware that new skins are added (select them, etc)
?- Reset camera button.
?- Depth-sort alpha
?- Multi-monitor support

1.3:
?- Hopefully, get an optimized color class (not super-high priority)
*- Verify all undo buffers
*- Secondary color
*- Merge Dodge and Burn into one tool
*- Darken/Lighten tool
*- Tool options (perhaps expandable panel below the toolbar?)
*- Finish the treeview
*- Add "Overlays" folder, customizable background image
*- Hidden part "ghosting"
*- Modifyable Brush Size for pencil/eraser/dodge/burn/darken/lighten, exposure for Dodge/Burn/Darken/Lighten, "feather" for pencil/eraser/dodge/burn/darken/lighten.
*- Noise tool
*- Circle brushes
*- Part lock for fill bucket/noise tool
\- Feathering on brushes
\- Grid for 2d view?
\- Find a better way to do the tool options
